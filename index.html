					<h2>Types Version Control</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Before starting, its important to know the how git compares to centralized SVn</p>

					<h3>Subversion</h3>
					<h4>A centralized approach</h4>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">You save to the same place as everyone else</li>
							<li class="fragment">When others save their work, you get affected</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Subversion stores additional copies of data on the local machine, which can become an issue with very large
							projects or files, or if developers work on multiple branches simultaneously.
						</p>

					<h3>GIT</h3>
					<h4>A distributed approach</h4>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Each person works independently from the centralized code</li>
							<li class="fragment">All changes are saved to the local repository</li>
							<li class="fragment">When changes are ready, connect to remote, push branch to repository </li>

					<h2>Under the Hood</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Git Object Model</h3>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment">BLOB</li>
						<li class="fragment">Tree</li>
						<li class="fragment">Commit</li>
						<li class="fragment">Tag</li>

					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							A blob holds the entire contents of a single file. It doesn’t hold any information about the name of the file or
							any other metadata, just the contents.
						</p>
						<p>
							A tree represents the state of a directory tree. It contains the pathnames of all the component files and their
							modes, along with the IDs of the blobs holding their contents. Note that there is no representation for a
							directory on its own, so a Git repository cannot record the fact that subdirectories were created or deleted,
							only the files in them.
						</p>
						<p>
							A commit points to a tree representing the state of the source tree as of immediately after that commit. It also
							records the date/time of the commit, the author/committer information, and pointers to any parent(s) of that
							commit, representing the immediately-prior state of the source tree.
						</p>
						<p>
							A tag is a name pointing to a commit. These are useful, for example, to mark release milestones. Tags can
							optionally be digitally signed, to guarantee the authenticity of the commit.

					<h2>Branching</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What are Branches?</h3>
					<p>They are a copy of the source tree.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Or, are they</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>So, what are branches then?</h3>
					<p class="fragment">A pointer to a commit, with a name.</p>
					<p class="fragment">Nothing is created, moved or deleted.</p>
					<p class="fragment">That pointer points to the latest commit, keeps geting updated.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is HEAD?</h3>
					<p class="fragment">References the latest commit</p>
					<p class="fragment">You could say it references the branch</p>

					<h2>Merge vs Rebase</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>What is a Merge?</h3>
					<p>
						Exactly what is sounds like, merging forked history.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases,
							git merge is used to combine two branches.
						</p>
						<p>
							Merge takes two commit pointers, usually the branch tips, and will find a common base commit between them. Once
							Git finds a common base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of each queued
							merge commit sequence.
						</p>

					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Merge Example</h3>
					<img class="fragment" src="img/m1.png" alt="">
					<img class="fragment" src="img/m2.png" alt="">
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							The top-most commit, the red one, is a new commit made by the merge; the merge commit is what reminds Git that a
							merge occurred next time it’s showing the history. This commit is special, as it contains multiple parent’s in
							it’s meta-data; these multiple parent’s allow Git to follow the two trees of commits that constituted the
							branches that were merged.
